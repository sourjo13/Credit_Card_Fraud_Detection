# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection

The data is a PCA transformed data

Learning algos applied:
1. Logistic Regression
2. SVM
3. Random Forest
4. XGBoost

The problem statement chosen for this project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions with the help of machine learning models.

 

In this project, you will analyse customer-level data that has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group. 

 

The data set is taken from the Kaggle website and has a total of 2,84,807 transactions; out of these, 492 are fraudulent. Since the data set is highly imbalanced, it needs to be handled before model building.
